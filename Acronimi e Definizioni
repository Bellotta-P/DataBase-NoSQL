COMPARISON QUERY OPERATIONS
  $GT = Greater Than , Selects those documents where the value of the field is greater than (i.e. >) the specified value.
  $LT = Less Than , Selects the documents where the value of the field is less than (i.e. <) the specified value.
  $IN = Operator selects the documents where the value of a field equals any value in the specified array
  $EQ = Operator matches documents where the value of a field equals the specified value.
  $regex = Provides regular expression capabilities for pattern matching strings in queries. MongoDB uses Perl compatible regular expressions

  $near = Specifica un punto dove la geospazialitÃ , dato un punto iniziale e un punto finale
  $minDistance = limits the results to those documents that are at least the specified distance from the center point.
  $maxDistance = limits the results to those documents that are at most the specified distance from the center point.
  $sort() for the query, sort() re-orders the matching documents, effectively overriding the sort operation already performed by $near
 
LOGICAL QUERY OPERATIONS
  $AND = performs a logical AND operation on an array of one or more expressions (<expression1>, <expression2>, and so on) and selects the documents that satisfy all the expressions
  $OR = operator performs a logical OR operation on an array of two or more <expressions> and selects the documents that satisfy at least one of the <expressions>
   
   MATCH = Filters the documents to pass only the documents that match the specified condition(s) to the next pipeline stage.
